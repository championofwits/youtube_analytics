# youtube_analytics

This is a project in which i will be using the the youtube api (v3) for data analytics .The edgame of the project is to convert it into a full fledged  site with django and Postgresql database to build an elaborate database instead of manually fetching from the website.



1)youtube api handler :
In this module we are simiply going to configure the API to fetch videos and channels to make our life easy


2)database module :
This will be a simple template / python wrapper for us to void typing those pesky sql queries.





FURTHER MODULES WILL BE ADDED AS I MAKE PROGRESS
